# OOPS

Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.

### Class

Class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions.  
It can also be called as blueprint of an object.

### Object

Object is an instance of a class. An object can operate on both data members and member functions.
